# TravellingSalesmanProblem

> This is a project to find the shortest way in a given graph with the help of two different methods, the nearest neighbour method and brute force

## How to make a text file that is compatible with this program
This program is reads the texfile from number to number and then from row to row. The first 3 rows in the text file only contains 1 number each. The first row is the node where you start. The second row contains the number of nodes in the graph. The third row contains the total amount of edges that exist in the graph. After those three rows all the remaining rows are the same. Each of the remaining rows represent an edge. The first number of the edge is the first node connected to the edge and the second number in the row is the second node connected to the edge. The third and final number is the weight of the edge. An example of this is show below.

### Example

```
1
5
10
1 2 39
1 4 20
1 5 12
1 3 45
2 3 20
2 4 28
5 2 42
3 5 48
3 4 40
4 5 18
```
